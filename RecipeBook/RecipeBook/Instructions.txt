Requirements

Allow users to create a recipe
Recipes have the following
                                                               i.      Title

TODO
* Implement all recipe buttons (frontend, test backend)
    - Should I re-do Open to be the AJAX call?
* Implement adding ingredients (frontend)
* Consider prompting before allowing the user to delete a recipe
* Finish restyling the filter control
* Review MVC principles
    - Am I using "Shared" correctly?
    - Should I have more Controller endpoints?
    - Should RecipeList be what it is?
    - When I'm more awake: did RecipeNavigationConfig make any sense at all?
    - Frankly to my sleepy brain "At least one operation should be done via Ajax using jQuery" and "use MVC!" feel at odds xD
*   Double-check CSS and Javascript adherence to best practices (I didn't 
* The right borders aren't lining up for the second recipe header row for some reason?
   -   They don't line up perfectly between the first and third at some resolutions either
