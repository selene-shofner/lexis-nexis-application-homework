Take home assignment

                Create a new recipe application using ASP.NET Core MVC and/or Razor Pages.  Application should use SQL Server. 

 

Take your time 😊 use web development and MVC! 

 

Requirements

+ Allow users to create a recipe
+ Recipes have the following
                                                               i.      Title

                                                             ii.      Description

                                                           iii.      Image

                                                           iv.      Ingredients (multiple)

                                                             v.      Instructions

+ Recipes should be persisted to the database
+ List of recipes
+ Viewing the list of recipes should be done with ASP.NET Core via MVC view, Razor Page or Ajax call using jQuery. Scaffolding should not be used.
+ Recipes should be able to be filtered.
+ Individual Recipe
+ Viewing an individual recipe should be done via either a MVC view or Razor Page.
+ At least one operation should be done via Ajax using jQuery
+ Site should use Bootstrap
+ Queries should use Entity Framework


TODO
* Implement all recipe buttons (frontend, test backend)
    - Implement the entire Edit functionality (I hid the button for now)
* Consider prompting before allowing the user to delete a recipe
* Refresh list when deleting a recipe
* Finish restyling the filter control
* Review MVC principles
    - Am I using "Shared" correctly?
    - Should I have more Controller endpoints?
    - Should RecipeList be what it is?  Maybe some of that state should live elsewhere, or that class should have a different name.
*   Double-check CSS and Javascript adherence to best practices
* The right borders aren't lining up for the second recipe header row for some reason?
   -   They don't line up perfectly between the first and third at some resolutions either
* Clear out scaffolding
* Break up CSS into page CSS files, when I first started working on this I forgot that was a feature in MVC as well as the frameworks I've been using more recently
* Clean up CSS
* Jazz up action menu more, rethink its positioning
* Make Add Recipe menu pop out from its opening button, reposition it
* Strongly consider adding newline stuff to all outputs


Stretch Goals:
 * Unit Tests
 * Data Validation
